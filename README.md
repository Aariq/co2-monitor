I built this thing: https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-trinkey-no-solder-air-quality-monitor

This repo has R code that will hopefully, maybe do the following:

- [x] read data from the CO2 monitor
- [x] collect said data in a tibble
- [ ] plot the data
- [ ] summarize the data (e.g. mean and max CO2)
- [ ] do a tweet with a hashtag (#ESA2022) and a room number
